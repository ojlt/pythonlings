# Pythonlings


Pythonlings is a CLI tool inspired by [rustlings](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/) that helps you practice Python through hands-on coding exercises.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pythonlings
```

## Usage

### Run the next pending exercise
```bash
pythonlings run
```

### Watch mode (auto-run on save, recommended)
```bash
pythonlings watch
```

### Get a hint
```bash
pythonlings hint
```

### List all exercises
```bash
pythonlings list
```

### Reset an exercise
```bash
pythonlings reset <exercise_name>
```

### Verify all exercises
```bash
pythonlings verify
```

## How It Works

1. Each exercise file contains a problem description and failing tests
2. Edit the exercise file to implement the solution
3. Tests run automatically when you save (in watch mode)
5. Move on to the next exercise!

## Exercises

30 exercises organized by difficulty:

- **Easy (7)**: strings, lists, math basics
- **Medium (15)**: dictionaries, file I/O, OOP, recursion
- **Hard (8)**: graphs, dynamic programming, advanced OOP
